# ECG-inversion-classification
The ECG is a time series that measures the electrical activity of the heart. This is the main tool to diagnose heart diseases. Recording an ECG is simple: 3 electrodes are placed at the ends of limbs, and 6 on the anterior chest.This generates 12 time series, called leads, each corresponding to a difference in potential between a pair of electrodes
